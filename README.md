Netfabb was consumed by Autodesk and the software we loved, Netfabb Basic
(and later Netfabb Free) is gone. No longer available to download in any version
for any platform.

Since the license terms of Netfabb Basic (see LICENSE) allows us to share it,
we are sharing installers of Netfabb found on our hard drives.

The PDF manuals are non-redistributable and currently still available from [netfabb.com](http://www.netfabb.com/manuals_download.php?nid=&fid=79).
If the release tarball contained them, they were removed.
